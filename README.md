All of the codes here have only been slightly altered by me and my team during our EMS516U laboratory sessions. 
The alterations have been mentioned in the report produced along with this code. 
The code here is in Arduino IDE format. 
The code's only intended use was for the OSOYOO V2.1 Robot for Arduino robotic vehicle and its corresponding report submission. 
This was done to ensure clarity, neatness and professionalism of aforementioned report.
