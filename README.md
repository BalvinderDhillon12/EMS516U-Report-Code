All of the codes here have only been slightly altered by me and my team during our EMS516U laboratory sessions in the School of Engineering & Material Sciences, Queen Mary University of London. 
The alterations have been mentioned in the report produced along with this code. 
The code here is in Arduino IDE format. Navigation follows that of the title of each algorithm implementation and their corrresponding code file here.
The code's only intended use was for the OSOYOO V2.1 Robot for Arduino robotic vehicle and its corresponding report submission. 
This was done to ensure clarity, neatness and professionalism of aforementioned report.
